								You can never find that piece of paper where you wrote the list of things you were supposed to remember to do. Did you leave it on your desk at work? Is it at the bottom of your bag? Did it meet it's fate in the washing machine in the pocket of the trousers you wore that day? We've all been there. Thankfully, with Wunderlist you can make a list wherever you are and be able to access it from wherever you go next, guaranteed!
